[#managing-apps-with-git-repositories]
= Managing apps with Git repositories

When you deploy Kubernetes resources using an application, the resources are located in specific repositories. Learn how to deploy resources from Git repositories in the following procedure. Learn more about the application model at xref:../manage_applications/app_model.adoc#application-model-and-definitions[Application model and definitions].

*User required access:* A user role that can create applications. Learn about access requirements from the link:../security/rbac.adoc#role-based-access-control[Role-based access control] documentation.

. From the console navigation menu, click *Manage applications*.

. Click *Create application*.

+
For the following steps, select *YAML: On* to view the YAML in the console as you create your application. See YAML samples later in the topic.

. Enter the following values in the correct fields:

+
* Name: Enter a valid Kubernetes name for the application.
* Namespace: Select a namespace from the list. You can also create a namespace by using a valid Kubernetes name if you are assigned the correct access role.

. Choose *Git* from the list of repositories that you can use.

. Enter the required URL path or select an existing path.

+
If you select an existing Git repository path, you do not need to specify connection information if this is a private repository. The connection information is pre-set and you do not need to view these values. 

+
If you enter a new Git repository path, you can optionally enter Git connection information if this is a private Git repository.

. Enter values for the optional fields, such as branch and folder.
 
. Set any optional pre and post-deployment tasks. 

+
*Technology preview:* Set the Ansible Tower secret if you have Ansible Tower jobs that you want to run before or after the subscription deploys the application resources. The Ansible Tower tasks that define Ansible jobs must be placed within prehook and posthook folders in this repository.

+
You can select an Ansible Tower secret from drop-down menu if a secret was created in the application namespace. In this instace, the connection information is pre-set, and you do not need to view these values. 

+
If you enter a new Ansible Tower secret name to create a new secret, you need to enter the Ansible Tower host and token.

. From _Select clusters to deploy_, you can update the placement rule information for your application. Choose from the following:

+
- Deploy on local cluster

- Deploy to all online clusters and local cluster

- Deploy application resources only on clusters matching specified labels

- You have the option to _Select existing placement configuration_ if you create an application in an existing namespace with placement rules already defined.
 
. From _Settings_, you can specify application behavior. To block or activate changes to your deployment during a specific time window, choose an option for _Deployment window_ and your _Time window configuration_.

. You can either choose another repository or Click *Save*.

. You are redirected to the _Overiew_ page where you can view the details and topology.

== Sample YAML

The following example channel definition shows an example of a channel for the Git Repository. In the following example, `secretRef` refers to the user identity used to access the Git repo that is specified in the `pathname`. If you have a public repo, you do not need the `secretRef`:

[source,yaml]
