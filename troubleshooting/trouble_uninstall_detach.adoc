== Resolving the problem: Failed uninstallation because resources exist

These errors occur when you try to uninstall the {product-title} hub cluster while it is still managing clusters, hosting bare metal assets, or collecting observability data. All of these resources must be removed before uninstalling the hub cluster. 


* To resolve the ManagedCluster error message, detach all clusters that are still being managed by the hub cluster and try to uninstall again. 

For more information about detaching clusters, see the _Removing a cluster from management_ section by selecting the information for your provider in link:../manage_cluster/create.adoc#creating-a-cluster[Creating a cluster].  

* To resolve the BareMetalAssets resources error message, remove all of the bare metal assets from the hub cluster and try to uninstall again.

For more information about removing the bare metal assets, see link:../manage_cluster/bare_assets.adoc#removing-a-bare-metal-asset[Removing a bare metal asset].

* To resolve the MultiClusterObservability resources error, remove all of the MultiClusterObservability resources from the hub cluster and try to uninstall again.
